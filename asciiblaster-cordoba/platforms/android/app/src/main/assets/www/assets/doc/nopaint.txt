               88      a brief tutorial :)

Last month or so I encountered Jeffrey Scudder's tool 'No Paint' -

https://www.nopaint.org/

- an automatic drawing tool with a minimal interface: you control it using
just two buttons.  The No Paint tool provided much entertainment on #sally,
so during some downtime I added similar functionality to the asdf.us/ascii
tool.  Under the brush, you should see two buttons - to kick it off, click
'paint' and it will begin drawing.

If you don't like what it's doing, click 'no' -
- this will remove the current line and start drawing a new line.

If you like what it's doing, click 'paint' -
- the line will be applied to the canvas, and it will start drawing anew.

While it's going, you can also click 'pause' and it will stop, so you can
save it or draw on it yourself.


Keyboard shortcuts -

left arrow  - 'no'
right arrow - 'paint'
down arrow  - 'pause'


Right-click toggles -

If you RIGHT-CLICK on "Paint" it will switch tools automatically.

If you RIGHT-CLICK on "No" it will engage TURBO MODE.
